# 🧘‍♀️ Light-Bulb Moment

While brainstroming the project ideas for this hackathon, we wanted to make a project which will help majority 
of the Princeton University's students and help them in their academic planning. 

While choosing courses students are often find it chaotic while shortlisting the courses. 
Not just that, even browsing through the courses offered in various majors is pretty tedious due to sheer volumn of the data. 
Switching webpages and remembering where the information is everytime is hectic in itself. 
There might be a slight chance that a student who is familiar with the university-website can successfully do it, but its too tedious 
and time consuming process. Not to mention a student who is thinking of applying for the first time - This will be a nightmare for them.

Thus, we present **Pton-Bot**! This is a bot which will ease out this process and make it a fun experience.
